# Datasets

**photoswitches.csv** contains the dataset used for property prediction.

**paper_allDB.csv** contains the large dataset of transition wavelengths from Beard et al. 2019

**dft_comparison.csv** contains the dataset on which the comparison against TD-DFT is performed.

**data_viz.csv** contains the portion of the dataset on which the visualization is performed.

All Wiberg index values were were calculated by using the Gaussian NBO version 3.1 as implemented in Gaussian 16 
(revision A03) through the analysis of the SCF density calculated at the PBE0/6-31G** level of theory as in [1].

Note dft_comparison.csv contains measurements for the same molecules under different solvents, both from the study of 
Jacquemin et al. [2] as well as for the original photoswitch dataset.
